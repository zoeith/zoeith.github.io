          <p> I was curious about the world around us so, I decided to study physics.
            I like coffee a lot and think liquid crystals look pretty, so I focused on soft matter physics.
            Then I felt it was urgent to more directly contribute back to society, so I started working with engineers.
            Polymers, additive manufacturing, soft robots, electronics, automation, and other adjacent technologies are exciting areas with ongoing developments that hold promise for all of us.
            Interested in the full stack: from fundamental physical principles to translating science from the bench to society.
